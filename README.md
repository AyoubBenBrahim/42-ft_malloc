the program break is the first location after the end of the uninitialized data segment

This is done via the brk() system call, which changes the point where the data segment "breaks"/ends.
malloc-s use sbrk for small allocations, mmap for large ones.

[figure1]

Resizing the heap (allocating or deallocating memory) is actually as simple as telling the kernel to adjust its idea of where the processâ€™s program break is. Initially, the program break lies just past the end of the uninitialized data segment (the same location as &end, shown in Figure2

The current limit of the heap is referred to as the program break.

The program break is the address of the first location beyond the current end of the data region of the program in the virual memory.

sbrk() increments the program's data space  by  increment  bytes.   Calling
       sbrk()  with  an increment of 0 can be used to find the current location of
       the program break.


```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

extern char etext, edata, end; // Symbols defined by the linker

int main() {
    void* current_brk = sbrk(0);
    void* data_end = &edata; // Address of the end of the data section

    printf("Current program break: %p\n", current_brk);
    printf("End of data section: %p\n", data_end);
    printf("End of program (end symbol): %p\n", &end);

    return 0;
}
```

analyse the result

(gdb) i r rax
rax 0x55ada9156000

(gdb) print &_edata
$9 = (<data variable, no debug info> *) 0x55ada8139038 <completed>

(gdb) p 0x55ada9156000 - 0x55ada8139038
$11 = 16895944

From the GDB output you provided, we can analyze the results as follows:

(gdb) info registers rax
The value stored in the %rax register is 0x55ada9156000. This value represents the address returned by the brk system call.

(gdb) print &_edata
The address of the _edata symbol is 0x55ada8139038. This symbol typically represents the end of the data section in the program's memory layout.

(gdb) p 0x55ada9156000 - 0x55ada8139038
The result of subtracting the address of _edata from the value in %rax is 16895944. This difference indicates the amount of memory that was dynamically allocated using the brk system call.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the brk system call was used to allocate approximately 16,895,944 bytes (or 16.1 MB) of memory. This memory was allocated beyond the end of the data section represented by the _edata symbol.
